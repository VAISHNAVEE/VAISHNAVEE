6 Months of research study in complex dynamical system and model it to predict apocalyptic events with rare phenomenon using specified combination method. This blended method uses both the data driven model and RNN model that analyse the sporadic events of high dimensional dynamic system and predict those events in sparse region efficiently. Galerkin projection method is used to minimize the dimensionality of the system as low-dimensional subspace.
